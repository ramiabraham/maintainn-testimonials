# Maintainn Testimonials

### A very lightweight testimonials plugin using slick.js (http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/).

- The idea here was to keep things *simple*, making the plugin easy to adapt for different carousel/slider requirements.

- There's one shortcode with one parameter (`number`) that controls `posts_per_page`.

- This plugin also registers the post type `testimonials` on init.

- "But there are no options, no settings page at all!" I know, right?

- "You should be able to control slider parameters with the `shortcode_atts`!" Go for it!

- "Why doesn't this have (fancy feature)?" This isn't Soliloquy. The goal here is to provide a simple starting point for whatever slider/carousel project you're forced to create for your client.

- Example: `[testimonials number="10"]`

- Example output:

- Nothing else.
