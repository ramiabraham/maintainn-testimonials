# Maintainn Testimonials

- A very lightweight testimonials plugin using slick.js (http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/).

- The idea here was to keep things simple, making the plugin easy to adapt for different carousel/slider requirements.

- There's one shortcode with one parameter (`number`) that controls `posts_per_page`.

- This plugin also registers the post type `testimonials` on init.

- Example: `[testimonials number="10"]`

- Example output:

- Nothing else.
